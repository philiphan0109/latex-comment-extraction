{"title": "A Simple Stationary Line Element for the Schwarzschild Geometry, and\n  Some Applications", "summary": "Guided by a Hamiltonian treatment of spherically symmetric geometry, we find\na remarkably simple -- stationary, but not static -- form for the line element\nof Schwarzschild (and Reissner-Nordstrom) geometry. The line element continues\nsmoothly through the horizon; by exploiting this feature we are able to give a\nvery simple and physically transparent derivation of the Hawking radiance. We\nconstruct the complete Penrose diagram by enforcing time-reversal symmetry.\nFinally we outline how an improved treatment of the radiance, including effects\nof self-gravitation, can be obtained.", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9406042v2", "id": "gr-qc9406042", "updated": "1994-06-27T12:55:21+00:00", "published": "1994-06-23T13:21:56+00:00", "authors": ["Per Kraus", "Frank Wilczek"], "categories": ["gr-qc", "hep-th"]}
