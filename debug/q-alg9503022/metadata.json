{"title": "Representations of Quantum Affine Algebras", "summary": "In this paper we define a quantum version of the ``fusion'' tensor product of\ntwo representations of an affine Kac-Moody algebra.It is replaced by what we\ncall fusion action of the category of finite-dimensional representations of\nquantum affine algebra on its highest weight representations. We construct a\nquantum version of the associativity constraint. We give categorical treatment\nof the subject and related questions ( like quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov\nequations).", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503022v1", "id": "q-alg9503022", "updated": "1995-03-31T19:02:42+00:00", "published": "1995-03-31T19:02:42+00:00", "authors": ["D.
