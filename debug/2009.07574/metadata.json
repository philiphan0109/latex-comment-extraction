{"title": "Second-order analysis of an optimal control problem in a phase field\n  tumor growth model with singular potentials and chemotaxis", "summary": "This paper concerns a distributed optimal control problem for a tumor growth\nmodel of Cahn-Hilliard type including chemotaxis with possibly singular\npotentials, where the control and state variables are nonlinearly coupled.\nFirst, we discuss the weak well-posedness of the system under very general\nassumptions for the potentials, which may be singular and nonsmooth. Then, we\nestablish the strong well-posedness of the system in a reduced setting, which\nhowever admits the logarithmic potential: this analysis will lay the foundation\nfor the study of the corresponding optimal control problem. Concerning the\noptimization problem, we address the existence of minimizers and establish both\nfirst-order necessary and second-order sufficient conditions for optimality.\nThe mathematically challenging second-order analysis is completely performed\nhere, after showing that the solution mapping is twice continuously\ndifferentiable between suitable Banach spaces via the implicit function\ntheorem. Then, we completely identify the second-order Fr\\'echet derivative of\nthe control-to-state operator and carry out a thorough and detailed\ninvestigation about the related properties.", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07574v2", "id": "2009.07574", "updated": "2023-06-05T08:28:25+00:00", "published": "2020-09-16T09:37:59+00:00", "authors": ["Pierluigi Colli", "Andrea Signori", "J\u00fcrgen Sprekels"], "categories": ["math.OC", "49J20, 49K20, 49K40, 35K57, 37N25"]}
