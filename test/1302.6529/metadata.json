{"title": "Heat kernel estimates for pseudodifferential operators, fractional\n  Laplacians and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators", "summary": "The purpose of this article is to establish upper and lower estimates for the\nintegral kernel of the semigroup exp(-tP) associated to a classical, strongly\nelliptic pseudodifferential operator P of positive order on a closed manifold.\nThe Poissonian bounds generalize those obtained for perturbations of fractional\npowers of the Laplacian. In the selfadjoint case, extensions to t in C_+ are\nstudied. In particular, our results apply to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann\nsemigroup.", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6529v4", "id": "1302.6529", "updated": "2013-10-08T13:24:55+00:00", "published": "2013-02-26T18:40:28+00:00", "authors": ["Heiko Gimperlein", "Gerd Grubb"], "categories": ["math.AP", "math.FA", "35K08, 58J35, 58J40, 47D06"]}
