  Comment Text: %The temporal evolution of chronic diseases plays an important role in providing appropriate treatment and improving patient care. Nonetheless, modeling the trajectory of diseases evolving through time is an extremely difficult task.

  Comment Text: % Personalized medicine has emerged as transformative fields in healthcare, promising tailored treatments that account for individual variations in patientsâ€™ characteristics. Deep learning (DL), has demonstrated unparalleled capabilities making it particularly well-suited for unraveling the rich information embedded in a patient's unique characteristics.
% However, while the impact of DL has been remarkable in various domains, its application to address the challenges posed by chronic neurological diseases with complex and heterogeneous temporal evolutions, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), remains a critical area of exploration. As a result, effective strategies for personalized medicine and precise interventions necessitate a comprehensive understanding of the intricate and varied trajectories that define the course of the disease \cite{Tomassini2019}. To this day, personalized and verifiable predictive imaging markers capable of anticipating future clinical disability progression in the context of MS are not well understood. Moreover, existing treatments have shown limited efficacy in slowing down progression across diverse patient sub-populations. This underscores the pressing need for DL models to overcome the complexities associated with modeling temporal and prolonged trajectories of degenerative diseases, essential for accurately predicting future clinical outcomes and treatment effects.

  Comment Text: % The entire long-term temporal trajectory contains valuable information that enables clinicians to anticipate the diverse manifestations of the disease. However, in real-world scenarios, this task is made difficult due to partially observed temporal data with irregular samples over a continuous time frame. Recent advances in DL methods were proposed in the literature to tackle the problem. Specifically, a new family of time series forecasting models, under the name of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) \cite{Chen2018}, were introduced, in which an ODE is parameterized by a trainable neural network. A step in the Neural ODE evolves the hidden state through time, making it a natural tool for modeling sequences.
% After its introduction, different variants of the model, including applications in the medical domain, were proposed \cite{Tang2022,DeBrouwer2019,jia2020neuralJump,Norcliffe2023

  Comment Text: % In this work, we aim to exploit 3D MRI data and tabular information in order to model and predict the evolution of MS patients' trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to predict longitudinal chronic disease evolution directly from high-dimensional 3D medical image (MRI) data, and associated clinical information. Other attempts have been made to exploit the unique ability of NODEs to predict disability evolution \cite{Lee2022} also in the context of MS \cite{DeBrouwer2021}, although they were limited to tabular data. To model disease evolution, the Expected Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, the most relevant clinical score to rank disability progression in MS, was considered. Additionally, our analysis is based on a large proprietary multi-trial, multi-scanner MRI (and associated clinical data) dataset of more than 3600 MS patients exposed to seven different treatment options and two subtypes of MS acquired during several randomized clinical trials (RCTs). A limiting factor in the applicability of NODE models in real-world scenarios is the inability to provide uncertainty surrounding a disability prediction. Recently published follow-up work \cite{Xuechen2020} considered the inclusion of a stochastic component to the ODE solver (NSDE). With adaptations for treatment effect \cite{debrouwer2022predicting}, we develop the first uncertainty-aware causal temporal model for the estimation of personalized treatment response based on continuous temporal disease evolution of EDSS trajectory predictions. Most importantly, the stochastic nature of MS and the noise in EDSS measurements make it hard to deterministically estimate a patient's trajectory evolution from an initial condition as required by the NODE solver. Instead, we propose to model the stochastic evolution of the disease by including a component based on the NSDE mode
