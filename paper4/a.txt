  Comment Text: 
 % Depression is a complex mental health condition affecting millions worldwide. While facial actions have shown promise in lab settings for understanding depression, their application in real-world scenarios remains largely unexplored due to challenges in designing efficient, deployable mobile systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce FacePsy, an open-source mobile sensing system capturing facial features, generating real-time data on facial behavior landmarks, eye movements, and head gestures, all through smartphones in natural settings, while preserving user privacy. Our research identifies specific head gestures and lip corner depressors as key indicators of depressive episodes. These findings have significant implications for designing improved mobile affective systems for mental health monitoring, prediction, and timely interventions.
